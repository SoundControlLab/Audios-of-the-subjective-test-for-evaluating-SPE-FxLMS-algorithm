# audios-of-the-subjective-test-for-evaluating-SPE-FxLMS-algorithm
This project shows the used audios of the subjective test in the article "Active noise control with selective perceptual equalization to shape the residual sound".
  In total, there are 16 recordings of reference sound, resultant from four transformers of two types and four work locations in the substation's control room. And there are 48 recordings of the residual sound, resultant from three different algorithms, four noise reduction levels, and four transformers of two types.
