# audios-of-the-subjective-test-for-evaluating-SPE-FxLMS-algorithm
  This project shows the used audios of the subjective test in the article "Active noise control with selective perceptual equalization to shape the residual sound".
  
  In total, there are 16 recordings of reference sound, resultant from four transformers of two types and four work locations in the substation's control room. And there are 48 recordings of the residual sound, resultant from three different algorithms, four noise reduction levels, and four transformers of two types.
  
## Naming rules for the audio of subjective text: 
### reference sounds:   "machine type_lable_target_ positionID.wav"
  machine type: power -- power transformer;  converter -- converter transformer
	lable: 1 -- transformer 1;    2 -- transformer 2
	positionID: which target position that the reference sound recorded in the control room of the transformer substation.
### stimuli: "machine type_lable _method_ nr.wav"
  machine type: power -- power transformer;  converter -- converter transformer
	lable: 1 -- transformer 1;    2 -- transformer 2
	method: FxLMS; Broadband ANE; SPE-FxLMS
	nr: the noise reduction level; 9dB, 12dB, 15dB, 18dB
